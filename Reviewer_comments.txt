Addressing comments from reviewers:

Reviewer 1:

+ Request for parasitic heat load estimates: Significant editing of manuscript to provide estimation of parasitic heat loads and methodology for estimating. Plot added showing result of process.

+ Request for elaboration of discrepant data: Added possible explanations for discrepancy and added information on the superconducting properties of Ti 15-3-3-3

Reviewer 2:

+ Request for conclusion synthesizing data of radioactivity and thermal conductivity: Added a final concluding remarks section which addresses difficulty of choosing a "best" material. Instead, I explain various parameters which will determine the material choice.

+ Typos fixed

+ Request for clarification in explanation of "good agreement" in data: re-worked caption of plot and added sentence in manuscript to explain further.
